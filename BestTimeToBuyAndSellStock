/*
Approach: one pointer iteration ->
Time complexity: O(n) because there is only one iteration
Space complexity: O(1), becuase there are few variables
Logic:
We asuume that prices[0] is min and then seek for min value in array
Max profit is simply maximum difference between some min found in past and any prices[i] in the array
